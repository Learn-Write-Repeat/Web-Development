#  ***CSS Display Techniques*** :innocent:
 
The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline part and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid, or flex.

Formally, the display property sets an element's interior and external display types. The exterior typeset an element's participation in current design; the internal type sets children's purpose. Some display values are fully described in their designations; for example, the detail of what happens when display: flex is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model specification.
