# Introduction to ES6 and ES7 Syntax
ES6 is Modern JavaScript. Its abbreviation form is ECMAScript 6 and it was released in 2015 with its full features, but in that time none of browsers could not implement ES6’s all stuffs. That time people used transpilers, it is one kind of library or application, that converts ES6 code to ES5, then the code of ES5 is executed by browsers. For this reason ES6’s adaptability was not improved. But after day-by-day, all browsers implemented it, and then it has become popular. 

## What is ES6:

ES6 is 6th version of ECMAScript and was published in 2015.
 ECMAScript is a general-purpose programming language. It is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of Web pages across different Web browsers. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web.
